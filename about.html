                    <h3>Jacob Henley is a researcher, developer, and engineer who transforms the way humans interact with complex systems.</h3>
                
                    <p>His research explores the intricate relationship between humans and automated systems, where he applies 
                        cognitive science principles to create interfaces that feel natural and inspire confidence. At the heart 
                        of his work lies a fundamental question: how can technology enhance human capabilities while maintaining 
                        intuitive interaction?</p>
                
                    <p>Drawing from his diverse background in psychology and software development, Jacob has consistently 
                        driven innovation across multiple disciplines. From streamlining development processes to optimizing 
                        manufacturing workflows, his solutions bridge the gap between human expertise and technical complexity. 
                        He specializes in transforming challenging technical systems into intuitive tools that users can trust 
                        and rely on with confidence.</p>
